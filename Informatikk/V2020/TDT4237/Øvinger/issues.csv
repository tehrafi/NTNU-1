"SQL injection";"User input for database interaction is not validated and the query does not use safe parameters. Allowing the user to tamper with most sql queries."
"Remote OS Command Injection";"The first time a user uploads a file to a task there is a new folder created by using the taskid. Tampering with the task id can allow for command injection when executing OS commands with the popen function in the Python os package."
"Default credentials";"The account user `admin` with password `password` is registered in the system by default. In addition the database also uses the account user `root` with password `root`."
"Weak lock out mechanism";"There are no lock out mechanisms to prevent password guessing attacks."
"Account Enumeration";"An adversary can view all registered users when applying for a project."
"Directory traversal/file include";"By knowing the static ip of a task file anyone can access the file without having read access to the project."
"Bypassing authorization schema";"User privilege validation is mostly performed on the client side. In this case it allows outside users without project access to perform task-deliveries and accept tasks. This must be done by sending a plain HTTP request instead of interacting through the client web page"
"Application error disclosure";"Error messages may appear up on exceptions"
"Clickjacking";"X-frame and X-content headers are not set."
"Insufficient Transport Layer Protection";"The application uses a guessable and static salt when hashing user passwords."
"Session Timeout";"The user session cookie doesnâ€™t expire before several months after it has been generated.";
"No logs";"There is no logging on the server. Making it nearly impossible to track attempts on malicious behaviour."
"Absence of Anti-CSRF tokens";"The application forms are not suited to prevent CSRF."
"Insecure deserialization";"The application performs insecure deserialization when reading the `remember` cookie using the Python Pickle package"
"Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities";"The application uses MD5 hashing for passwords. In addition the mysql-connector Python package is deprecated."
