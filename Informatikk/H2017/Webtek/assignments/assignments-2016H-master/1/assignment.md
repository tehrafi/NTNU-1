# Assignment 1: HTML introduction

In this assignment you will create a page for introducing yourself, with an image and everything (well not everything, only a text in addition to the image).

## Part 1: Get Started
Create a HTML file and name it ```about.html```.  This page will be a short introduction about you. Structure the document properly. Add the three elements `header`, `section`, and `footer`. In the header element, include an h1 heading element stating your name.

In the section element, first include a new header element, then an image and three paragraphs below the header. The three paragraphs must contain some text about:
* your coding skills, and
* your expectations to the course, respectively.

In the `header` element within the section add an h2 heading tag containing the title "This is me".

Include the image between the heading and the first paragraph. It might be an image of anything. It can be a picture of you in a cape, or it can be a picture of something entirely different.

In the footer, write "Created by Your Name". Of course, subside the "your name" with your actual name.

Don’t worry about styling just yet, we’ll save that for the next assignment. It is important that you structure the elements correctly. You will only have to make minimal changes to the html file later.

## Part 2: Add your first icon
We want to have a page that screams professionalism. A page without a favicon does not. Make sure to add a favicon that is supported in most browsers. The favicon can be one you have created on your own, or the one provided.

## Part 3: Questions
Create a new section element, below your previous, but above the footer. Add a header element to it, and fill it with an h2 tag containing the title "Questions".

Below the heading element, write a numbered list. Make the content of the list the answers for the questions below.

1. What does the server in the client server architecture do?
2. What does the client do?
3. What is an IP address?
4. What is DNS?
5. What is the difference between the Internet and WWW?
6. Explain what HTML is

## Deliverables
For this assignment, deliver ```about.html``` in a zip file on it's learning before the deadline. Submissions are ONLY accepted via Its Learning. We DON’T accept late assignments. Emails or any other messages with late assignments are automatically discarded without further communication.

## Publish your website
Students can establish a directory in which they can store web pages that will be delivered by NTNU’s web server. You can see how here: [https://innsida.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/Create+your+own+website](https://innsida.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/Create+your+own+website).
If you have any problem with that please attend the first Lab session (Week 36) to get assistance.
